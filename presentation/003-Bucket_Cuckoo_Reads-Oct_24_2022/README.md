# Introduction

I decided to measure the average read size operations based on the bucket size
and the bound size. The results don't make a ton of sense. Included in this
directory are the results. I took the experiment assuming that each entry in the
hash table is 64 bits. I would have assumed that the trends in this chart would
have followed my expected results perfectly. However they are a bit off even
with a large number of trials. 

I think that the only thing here to do is think a bit more.
