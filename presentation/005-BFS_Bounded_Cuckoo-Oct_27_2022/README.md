# Introduction

I decided to check out the improvements that I could gain from using BFS to determine the cuckoo path, rather than just using dfs random search.
[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-eurosys14.pdf](Algorithmic Improvement
for fast concurrent cuckoo Hashing), Figure 4 shows the BFS version of cuckoo
path insertion. 

After completing the BFS algorithm I ran the same fill test that I ran before running 32 experiments each, and then taking
