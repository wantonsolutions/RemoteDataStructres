\title{Remote Memory Cuckoo Hashing}

\section*{Abstract}

Memory disaggregation promises high resource utilization,
and efficient resource sharing. However designing fully
disaggregated systems remains challenging due to the high
latency of remote memory. Key-value store indexes often
adopt a ~\textit{partially disaggregated} approach where
updates to the index are routed through a CPU for
serialization, while reads
 are made directly to memory.
Fully disaggregated indexes assume no such CPU and must
serialize updates entirely with remote clients.

This paper focuses on the design of a
 fully
 disaggregated
lock-based key-value index based on cuckoo
 hashing. Prior
work avoids locks in favor of optimistic concurrency as
locks can have large critical sections and quickly
bottleneck performance. However, optimistic approaches
require multiple round trips for each operation, as atomic
updates are limited to 64 bits with RDMA atomics. 

In this work we show that
with careful data structure and protocol design, as well as
the architecture of modern RDMA NICs traditional locking
strategies can perform better than state of the art
optimistic concurrency algorithms. We demonstrate this
through the design of a remote memory key value store based
on cuckoo hashing. Our cuckoo hashing algorithm (rcuckoo)uses dependent,
rather than independent hash functions to increase the
probability that both hashes of a key will be
close in the hash table. This locality enables fast lock
acquisition and release. We demonstrate that rcuckoo
outperforms optimistic concurrency algorithms by 2x in
terms of throughput and up to a 2x improvement on read
latency.
