\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we design and implement a lock based cuckoo
hash for remote memory. Using dependent hashing, a carefully
designed locking protocol, and the latest RDMA NIC features
we achieve common case operations of 2 round trips, and
lockless reads in a single round trip. We demonstrate that
these algorithmic advantages lead to better practical
performance by simulating hash table workloads and showing
throughput and latency benefits of up to 2x over state of
the art far memory hash tables.
