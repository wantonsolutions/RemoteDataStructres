\section{Implementation}

Our implementation of RCukcoo consists of a of 8.7k C++
implementation and a 12k line Python implementation which
simulates RDMA. Both implementations will be made available
on Github.  All results reported in Section~\ref{sec:eval}
are from the C++ implementation. At the time of writing only
the python implementation includes support for update,
delete, and extent entries. As such all C++ results are for
inserts, reads, and inlined table operations.  RCuckoo is
designed for ConnectX-5 NICs. It uses OFED-4.9 which
supports experimental verbs for atomic masked CAS and device
mapped memory.
