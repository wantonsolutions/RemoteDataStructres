\section{Implementation}

Our implementation of RCukcoo consists of a of 8.7k C++ implementation and a 12k line Python
implementation which simulates RDMA. Both implementations will be made available on Github.  All
results reported in Section~\ref{sec:eval} are from the C++ implementation.  RCuckoo is designed for
ConnectX-5 NICs. It uses OFED-4.9 which supports experimental verbs for atomic masked CAS and device
mapped memory.
