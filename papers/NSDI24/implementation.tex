\section{Implementation}

Our implementation of RCukcoo consists of \todo{7k} lines of
C++ code. RCuckoo is designed for ConnectX-5 NICs. It uses
OFED-4.9 which supports experimental verbs for atomic masked
CAS and device mapped memory. Our implementation is open
source and will be made available on Github.
