\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we design and implement a lock-based cuckoo hash table
for passive remote memory. Using dependent hashing, a carefully
designed locking protocol, and the latest RDMA NIC features we achieve
single-round-trip reads, update operations that require two round
trips when uncontested, and insert operations that require only two
round trips in the median case.  Even in the face of high contention
and nearly full tables, client caching limits I/O amplification.
Moreover, our step-by-step insert protocol enables fully disaggregated
failure detection and recovery.  Future work could consider employing
a data replication strategy that addresses server failure in a
similarly disaggregated manner.
