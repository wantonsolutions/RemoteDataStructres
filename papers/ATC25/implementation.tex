\subsection{Implementation}

We have built two separate versions of RCuckoo, an 8.7~K-line C++
implementation tuned for high performance and a 12~K-line Python
implementation that simulates RDMA operations to facilitate
correctness testing. Both implementations will be made available on
GitHub at publication.  We report results using our C++
implementation which requires OFED-4.9 to support masked CAS
operations and device-mapped memory on ConnectX-5 NICs.  All
experiments use 64-KB client index-table caches and
a virtual lock table at the server.
