\section*{Abstract}

%% Memory disaggregation promises high resource utilization,
%% and efficient resource sharing. However designing fully
%% disaggregated systems remains challenging due to complex
%% serialization, high latency, and failures. Key-value store 
%% indexes often adopt a partially disaggregated approach
%% where writes to the index are routed through a CPU for
%% serialization, while reads are made directly to memory.
%% Fully disaggregation assumes no such CPU and must serialize
%% writes entirely with clients.

RCuckoo is a fully disaggregated lock-based key/value store in which
clients cooperatively access a passive memory server using exclusively
one-sided RDMA operations.  RCuckoo employs cuckoo hashing to enable
single round-trip reads of small values while updates and deletes
require only two.  We introduce locality-enhanced dependent hashing
that allows us to adjust the expected distance between a key's
potential table locations, 
significantly improving insertion performance over previous cuckoo-hashing
approaches while reducing I/O amplification and preserving high fill factors.
We show that not only does RCuckoo outperform all existing
state-of-the-art RDMA-based key/value stores when reading small values, but under
severe contention RCuckoo delivers up to 7$\times$ the throughput
of comparison systems across the standard set of YCSB workloads.  Moreover,
RCuckoo's lease-based locking mechanism enables it to gracefully
recover from 100s of client failures per second.

%% lock based cuckoo hash. Prior work avoids locks in favor of optimistic
%% concurrency as locks can have large critical sections and complex
%% failures. We show that that with careful design locks can have higher
%% performance than opportunistic algorithms and recover from failures
%% quickly.  We develop a locality based hashing algorithm which enables
%% fast reads, and efficient locking. We compare our performance against
%% state of the art key value stores and show gains on an YCSB benchmarks
%% against all systems achieving between 1.4x to 10x on write heavy
%% workloads and 1.3x to 2.2x on read heavy workloads.


% with careful data structure and protocol design, as well as
% the architecture of modern RDMA NICs traditional locking
% strategies can perform better than state of the art
% optimistic concurrency algorithms. We demonstrate this
% through the design of a remote memory key value store based
% on cuckoo hashing. Our cuckoo hashing algorithm (RCuckoo)uses dependent,
% rather than independent hash functions to increase the
% probability that both hashes of a key will be
% close in the hash table. This locality enables fast lock
% acquisition and release. We demonstrate that RCuckoo
% outperforms optimistic concurrency algorithms by 2x in
% terms of throughput and up to a 2x improvement on read
% latency.
